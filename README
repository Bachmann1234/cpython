This is a fork of python that allows arbitrary unicode characters as identifiers.

Why would you do this?
    Don't... it is a bad idea. Python restricts the unicode identifiers based on recommendations by Unicode Consortium
    Chances are using this would lead to very bad code and potentially opens up a new attack vector.

Ok... Why did you do this
    Because it is fun to make code like this: https://gist.github.com/Bachmann1234/a7d7a2fb9a495646df88

It would be possible to *just* allow emoji but as this is not meant to be serious I did the easiest thing
